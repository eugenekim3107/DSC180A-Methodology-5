Section B15 with Professor Jingbo Shang

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic I learned this quarter was from the paper "CLUSTERLLM: Large Language Models as a Guide for Text Clustering" published by Zhang et al. In this paper, they use large langauge models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to guide text clustering. Since users do not have access to the learned embeddings of ChatGPT, the authors introduce a prompting technique to indirectly retrieve useful information from ChatGPT. They ask ChatGPT to solve triplet tasks to disambiguate points that seem to belong to more than one cluster.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

I would like to investigate different ways to the combine personalized data and real-time data with ChatGPT. This can help me create applications or websites more tailored toward specific individuals. The current state of ChatGPT is limited to the general public data. Since most people have different personal preferences, I would like to incorporate personalized data with ChatGPT to tailor toward each individual differently.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I would like to start by taking more time formulating my Quarter 2 Project proposal and creating a concrete step-by-step plan before beginning the hands-on work (such as coding). This can help prevent any roadblocks when completing tasks due to disorganization. Many times, I find myself rushing into the project without a clear plan.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I am planning to create a mobile application incorporating ChatGPT. Therefore, I would like to learn more about mobile app development. I am not too familiar with this area, especially for backend servers of mobile apps. I need to collect the personalized data and real-time data and use it with ChatGPT for my app idea.
